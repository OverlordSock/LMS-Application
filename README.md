# LMS-Task-4

This application was designed for keeping track of livestock and profits for a small farm.
Livestock entries can be added, removed, and updated via the Management Tab.
Profit statitstics and statistics by criteria like livestock type are available in the Statistics Tab.

KNOWN ISSUE: Using this application without an installer (not yet included) will result in the packaged .db file
             being read as empty, resulting in no records visible and statistics calculations returning either zero
             or divide-by-zero exception strings where calculated outputs appear.
